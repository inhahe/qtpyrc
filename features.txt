auto-size nicks pane to fit largest nick
beep when message comes into a given channel
scripting
 do this via mixins?  no.  use a list of script classes and im_func.
 don't use __init__. use init().
 have an isconnected variable.
 actually use __init__.  it passes a 'main' variable for the main ircclient.
 all functions receive self, main, rest of arguments.
 use __getattribute__ of ircclient class to call its own function and then the bots' functions.
   to use that must inherit 'object'.
   also use object.__getattribute__ within __getattribute__ for avoiding infinite recursion.
add and remove event handlers on the command line (respond x times or respond indefinitely)
default mirc color for outgoing messages
(limit to certain channels)
show warning or auto-reconnect if no ping received within x seconds
  connec to various servers and determine ping intervals
option to run without gui or pyqt as a bot
 might be best not to import any * from pyqt so we can just create dummy objects for the
 namespaces for which any attribute returns a dummy object for which any attribute returns
 the dummy object
alternative console mode?  make a ConsoleWindow class and if console mode is selected
 then Window = ConsoleWindow, etc.
on hover, show
  nick
  ident if avail
  host if avail
  location using an ip2loc database if host is numeric or user performed a dns on it already
  realname if avail (user did a whois already)
  channels if avail
  ctcp version reply if avail (user did a ctcp version)
  time if avail
  time since they joined chan
  time since they joined any chan youre in (for these, if they were already in chan say
                                            it was at least however many minutes you were there)
  idle time from whois if avail
  whether theyre irc cop if avail
  whether away if avail
  other nicks the user has used
   other nicks the user has used in different sessions?
  time since last spoke in any chan
  time since last spoke in chan
  +v/+o/+b status (use mode changes and ban list for +b status)
  mention the user cannot speak if +b or -v and chan is +m
   don't some servers have a +mute mode? find out what any extra nick prefixes are
keep a database tracking user identity by ident@host and simultaneous host login?
 also identical any two: host, ident, realname, nick  (maybe not realname, many people are 'new now know how')
 identical if ident and it starts with i= (freenode)
 does /whois report if a user is using a registered nick?
provide channel buffers for bot
 use gzip if it's effective over single sentences
should bots be done via mixins? no.
pop-up ansi color picker like mirc has?
 use ctrl-c for colors?
color rgb configurator?
support any windows registered scripting language like klient does
/notify can be network-specific
can pick a different random /whois every time you login
when rejoining:
 when rejoin show line.. maybe with time lapse between part/join
 simulated joins/parts/modes/topic changes to show changes? use different color or different format
quick creation of aliases, e.g., /alias "/srvcdc" = "/server irc.cdc.net"
emulate mirc to things liike the iwnamp plugin
dcc -- way to enter ip address directly instead of nick ??

provide a function to find a user? given a nick, start joining and parting all channels in /list and look for them
 password protected channels can be entered using split detection, but servers ban that.
 channels you're banned from can be circumvented using a bnc or a server that can't resolve your ip
  or perhaps by using ipv6?
  also by changing nickname and ident
 make multiple connections to different servers and do this in parallel
 call this function, ultra-stalk.
 also look in logs for all channel names joined and in /whois's because they may have become
 private since then, which would be a good reason it doesnt show up in the /whois of someone you know.

include chess bot, !seen, !memo, !quote, the fake /msg conversationalist
provide a sandbox for scripts? find some third party sandbox? allow writing to the bot's dir, if not that then an sqlite database
